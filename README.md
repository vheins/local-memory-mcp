**MCP Local Memory Service** is a high-performance [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that provides long-term, high-signal memory for AI Agents (such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, or Windsurf).

Built with a **Local-First** philosophy, this service stores architectural decisions, code patterns, and critical facts locally on your machine using SQLite and AI-powered Semantic Search.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🧠 **Semantic Search (V2):** Find memories based on meaning, not just keywords, using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model locally with hybrid TF-IDF + vector ranking.
- 🔄 **Tech-Stack Affinity:** Share knowledge across repositories intelligently based on technology tags.
- 🛡️ **Anti-Hallucination Guard:** Strict similarity thresholds and decision conflict detection.
- 🧩 **Knowledge Graph:** Structured entities, relations, and observations with auto-extraction via offline NLP.
- 🕰️ **Time Tunnel:** Query memories with natural language dates ("yesterday", "last week").
- 📉 **Soul Maintenance:** Biological-style memory decay with tag immunization — automatically archives obsolete memories.
- 🤖 **Agentic Tools:** One-call session context (`agent-context`), structured decision logging via `memory-write` (`type: "decision"`), LLM-driven knowledge synthesis (`synthesize`), and per-repo project summaries (`repo-summarize`).
- 📊 **Glassy Dashboard:** Visualize memories, tasks, handoffs, knowledge graph, and interaction logs through a modern Svelte 5 interface.
- 🔍 **Codebase Index:** Index and query source code structure — search for functions, classes, interfaces, types, and enums across your projects. Uses tree-sitter WASM for fast parsing with incremental updates.
- 🧭 **Codebase Search & Trace:** A single unified tool (`codebase-read`) with auto-detected modes — search ranked symbols (`query`), trace a symbol's definition and call sites (`name`), list the symbols declared in a file (`filePath`), or explore the architecture overview (`depth`). `codebase-index` builds and refreshes the tree-sitter index.

## 🔌 MCP Usage & Configuration

Add this service to your AI Agent (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) using one of the methods below.

> 💡 **Recommendation:** If your MCP runs frequently (agents, CI, automation), avoid `npx` and use a global or local install instead. It reduces unnecessary NPM downloads and speeds up Agent startup.

### 🚀 Quick Start (Zero Setup)

Best for **first-time users** or **quick testing**. This uses `npx` to run the server without any permanent setup.

```json
"local-memory": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@vheins/local-memory-mcp"],
  "type": "stdio"
}
```

- **Uses `npx`**: Automatically handles the execution.
- **Tradeoff**: May re-download the package in some environments and is not optimal for frequent execution.

### ⚡ Recommended for Production / Frequent Usage

This method ensures the fastest startup times and maximum reliability for daily use.

1. **Install globally:**

   ```bash
   npm install -g @vheins/local-memory-mcp
   ```

2. **Add to your configuration:**
   ```json
   "local-memory": {
     "command": "local-memory-mcp",
     "type": "stdio"
   }
   ```

- **Faster startup**: No network checks required on every start.
- **No repeated downloads**: Saves bandwidth and avoids NPM registry dependency.
- **Better for automation**: More stable for heavy-duty Agent workflows.

### 🌐 Daemon Mode (Shared Transport — Recommended)

By default, every MCP client window spawns its own `local-memory-mcp` process. If you open many editor windows or run several agents at once, you end up with N × M processes all competing for the same SQLite database — causing CPU spikes and `SQLITE_BUSY` errors.

**Daemon mode** solves this: run **one** background process that serves both the MCP HTTP endpoint and the dashboard on a single port, then point all clients at it.

#### Quick start

```bash
# Install globally first (recommended)
npm install -g @vheins/local-memory-mcp

# Start the daemon in the background
local-memory-mcp daemon

# Check it is running
local-memory-mcp daemon status
# → Daemon is running (pid 12345) on http://127.0.0.1:3456

# Stop it
local-memory-mcp daemon stop
```

Or without a global install:

```bash
npx -y @vheins/local-memory-mcp@latest daemon
```

#### Auto-start on system boot

```bash
# Install as a system service (picks the right mechanism per platform)
local-memory-mcp daemon install

# Remove the service
local-memory-mcp daemon uninstall
```

| Platform | Mechanism                | Service file location                                            |
| :------- | :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux    | systemd user service     | `~/.config/systemd/user/local-memory-mcp.service`                |
| macOS    | launchd LaunchAgent      | `~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.github.vheins.local-memory-mcp.plist` |
| Windows  | Task Scheduler (ONLOGON) | Task name: `local-memory-mcp-daemon`                             |

#### Point your MCP clients at the daemon

Replace the `stdio` entry in your client config with an HTTP entry (no token needed — loopback only):

**OpenCode (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`)**

```json
"local-memory": {
  "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3456/mcp",
  "type": "http"
}
```

**Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`)**

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"local-memory": {
			"url": "http://127.0.0.1:3456/mcp"
		}
	}
}
```

The dashboard is available at `http://127.0.0.1:3456` — same port, no extra process.

> Clients that don't support HTTP MCP (older versions) can keep using the `stdio` entry alongside the daemon — both modes share the same SQLite database.

#### Daemon subcommands

| Command            | Description                                           |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `daemon`           | Start the daemon (fork to background, write PID file) |
| `daemon stop`      | Stop the running daemon                               |
| `daemon status`    | Show whether the daemon is running and on which port  |
| `daemon install`   | Register as a system service for auto-start on boot   |
| `daemon uninstall` | Remove the system service                             |

#### Environment variables

| Variable                    | Default | Description                                    |
| :-------------------------- | :------ | :--------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`                      | `3456`  | Port for the combined daemon (MCP + dashboard) |
| `MEMORY_DB_BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS` | `30000` | SQLite busy timeout in ms                      |

#### Notes

- The daemon binds to `127.0.0.1` (loopback) only — not accessible from other machines.
- All sessions share one SQLite database; concurrent writes use bounded jittered retry so `SQLITE_BUSY` errors no longer surface under multi-client load.
- Logs are written to `~/.config/local-memory-mcp/daemon.log`.

### 🧠 How It Works (Important Insight)

- **npx usage**: When you use `npx`, it often performs a network request to check for the latest version or re-downloads the package if it's not in the cache. Since MCP clients start and stop tools frequently, this can lead to hundreds of unnecessary downloads.
- **Installed binary**: By installing the package, you keep a permanent copy on your disk. The Agent reuses this local version instantly, providing a much smoother experience.

### Database Maintenance: Reclaim Disk Space

After pruning or large data cleanups, SQLite can retain freed pages in its **freelist** for reuse instead of shrinking the database file. `VACUUM_ON_STARTUP` (default: `false`) opts into a one-time conversion to `auto_vacuum=INCREMENTAL`, followed by a full `VACUUM` that reclaims those pages before the MCP server accepts requests.

#### One-off CLI startup

Close other MCP clients and dashboard processes using the same database first: a full `VACUUM` needs a write lock and can delay startup. Use the same `MEMORY_DB_PATH` setting as your normal server if you have overridden the database location.

Run **one** of these commands in a POSIX shell (macOS/Linux):

```bash
# With the globally installed package
VACUUM_ON_STARTUP=true local-memory-mcp

# Alternatively, without a global install
VACUUM_ON_STARTUP=true npx @vheins/local-memory-mcp
```

The variable applies only to that invocation. This is **not a maintenance-and-exit command**: after the pass, the normal stdio MCP server continues running. Check the `[Server] VACUUM_ON_STARTUP ran` log and its `changed`, `skipped`, and `reason` fields; stop the standalone server with Ctrl+C after the pass finishes, then restart your normal client.

#### Claude Desktop / Cursor configuration

For Claude Desktop, open **Settings → Developer → Edit Config** (`claude_desktop_config.json`). Merge this entry into your existing `mcpServers` object; preserve other servers and any existing `env` values such as `MEMORY_DB_PATH`:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"local-memory": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "@vheins/local-memory-mcp"],
			"env": {
				"VACUUM_ON_STARTUP": "true"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

For Cursor, use the same configuration in `.cursor/mcp.json` (project) or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global), adding `"type": "stdio"` inside the `local-memory` entry. For a global package install in either client, use `"command": "local-memory-mcp"` and remove `args`.

Restart the client to apply the setting. **Enable it for one planned reclamation startup, then remove/unset `VACUUM_ON_STARTUP` (or set it to `"false"`)** so ordinary startups stay fast and do not retry an expensive conversion or encounter unnecessary write-lock contention.

#### Safety and limitations

- **Disk headroom:** with the default guard, available space on the database filesystem must be at least **2 × database size + 16 MiB**. Database size is `page_count × page_size`; the temporary rewrite and WAL need extra room. Insufficient space produces `skipped: true`, `reason: "insufficient_disk"`. If the filesystem free-space probe is unavailable, the implementation proceeds rather than blocking, so verify headroom yourself.
- **Idempotent:** an already-INCREMENTAL database returns `changed: false`, `reason: "already_incremental"`; it does **not** run another full `VACUUM` or reclaim newly freed pages through this flag. Subsequent bounded incremental reclamation is part of the startup maintenance sweep in the `full` runtime profile.
- **Never-throw startup pass:** conversion errors are logged and returned as `skipped: true`, `reason: "error"`, rather than aborting startup. In-memory databases are skipped with `reason: "in_memory"`. This is not a guarantee that unrelated server startup operations cannot fail.
- **Scope:** the flag applies to normal MCP server startup in every runtime profile, not the standalone dashboard. It does not impose a maintenance timeout or remove the cost of a full database rewrite.

### How to Run

```bash
local-memory-mcp dashboard
```

_If not installed globally, use:_ `npx @vheins/local-memory-mcp dashboard`

### Developer Workflow (Dashboard UI)

The dashboard UI is built with **Svelte 5 + Vite**. Source files live in `src/dashboard/ui/`.

```bash
# Start the API server (port 3456)
# Note: `npm run dashboard` serves the compiled bundle — run `npm run build` once first (`dist/dashboard/public/`)
npm run dashboard

# In a separate terminal, start the Svelte dev server (port 5173)
npm run dashboard:dev
# → Open http://localhost:5173 (proxies /api to :3456)

# Build Svelte UI for production (output → dist/dashboard/public/)
npm run dashboard:build

# Full production build (Svelte + TypeScript)
npm run build
```

> The server serves the compiled Svelte build from `dist/dashboard/public/` in production.

### Auto-launch Dashboard in IDEs

The dashboard can auto-start when you open a project in VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, or JetBrains IDEs.
