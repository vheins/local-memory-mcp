/**
 * FEAT-DAEMON-002D — embedding worker parity + resolution + non-blocking proof.
 *
 * Proves the off-main-thread embedding path (`src/mcp/workers/embedding.worker.ts`,
 * driven by the generic WorkerPool) produces embeddings BYTE-IDENTICAL to the
 * in-process path, degrades gracefully to in-process when the worker is
 * unavailable, and — the point of the task — keeps the main event loop
 * responsive during a batch.
 *
 * The in-process reference is built from the SAME shared runtime
 * (`storage/embedding-runtime.ts`) the worker uses, so this test pins the whole
 * contract end to end: real ONNX in a worker thread vs. real ONNX on the main
 * thread.
 *
 * The model download (first run) can exceed the default timeout — hence the
 * long per-test timeout. If ONNX cannot load at all (offline CI), the
 * ONNX-dependent tests SKIP rather than fail, mirroring `lightness.perf.test.ts`.
