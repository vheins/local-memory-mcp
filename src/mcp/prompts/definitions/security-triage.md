## Security Triage

Classify via web_search (CVE/CVSS). Assess exploitability (reachability + attack scenarios). Assess impact (CIA triad). Remediate with priority P0-P3 + fix steps. Verify with testing method.

Web search MUST be delegated to a coding subagent (general/explore). Main agent must NOT execute web_search directly.

For detailed FSM execution (S0→S5 with guards), load the `security-triage` skill.
