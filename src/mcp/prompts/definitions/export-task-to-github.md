## Export Task to GitHub

Fetch task via task-detail. Sync check via search_issues for task_code — if exists, update metadata with URL; skip re-creation. Create issue via issue_write (match content). Post comments. Link task-update with GitHub URL. Verify issue exists.

MCP + GitHub tools ONLY.

For detailed FSM execution (S0→S5 with guards), load the `export-task-to-github` skill.
