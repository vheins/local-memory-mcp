## Technical Planning

Sequence: tech-stack-selection → architecture-design → domain-modeling → database-schema-planning → api-contract-design → derive sprints → sprint-planning tasks + allocation audit + MCP task tree. Optional: capacity-planning, event-storming, microservices-boundary, SLA/SLO.

Gates: approve stack+arch, approve domain+db, approve API contracts, final approval.

For detailed FSM execution (A1→A6 with gates), load the `technical-planning` skill.
