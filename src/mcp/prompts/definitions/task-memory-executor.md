## Main Loop

Sync identity, tasks, handoffs. Hydrate task details (cache once). Check dependency readiness. Claim task. Load required skills (if metadata.required_skills set). Research via memory-search + standard-search. Execute changes. Validate (tests, linters, type-check, UI check). Finalize: task-update + memory-store + decision-log + commit.

Infinite loop until queue exhausted. Max 2 parallel sub-agents. Blocker handling: classify as internal (auto-create fix task) or external (keep blocked).

For detailed FSM execution (S0→S9 with guards + blocker sub-FSM + backlog maintenance), load the `task-memory-executor` skill.
