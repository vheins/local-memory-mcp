## Review and Post Issue

Sequential discovery: docs → code → UI. Pre-issue analysis: agent-context + memory-search + search_issues dedup. Design issues (atomic, strict body format, labels). Create via issue_write. Verify issue count matches gap count.

Forbidden: NO code/edit/delete — GitHub+MCP tools ONLY. Issue body format: Context & Analysis / Step & Implementation / Acceptance & Verification.

For detailed FSM execution (S0→S4 with guards), load the `review-and-post-issue` skill.
