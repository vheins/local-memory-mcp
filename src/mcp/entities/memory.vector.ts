	 * Candidate (memory_id, vector) rows for the vector-search fallback,

	 *
	 * **Empty `owner` means ANY owner (audit F7).** The previous shape treated a
	 * truthy `repo` as "filter on both columns" and interpolated `owner!` —
	 * which meant the sole production caller, `RealVectorStore.search`, always
	 * emitted `WHERE m.owner = '' AND m.repo = ?` because it passes a hardcoded
	 * empty-string owner. Memories are stored with a REAL owner (the GitHub
	 * org/username), so on a real database only 380 of 710 vectorized memories
	 * (54%) had `owner = ''` and the other **330 (46%) could never match the
	 * query at all** — for one repo the candidate set went from 44 rows with the
	 * correct owner to 0 rows with the empty one.
	 *
	 * The bug was masked because `memory.read` only reaches the vector stage
	 * when the TF-similarity + FTS pipeline produced zero candidates, so the
	 * failure looked like "vector search didn't add anything" rather than an
	 * error. Treating an empty owner as "unscoped" both fixes it and matches the
	 * sibling stores: `standards.getVectorCandidates(repo)` and
	 * `tasks.getTaskVectorCandidates(repo)` take no owner at all.
