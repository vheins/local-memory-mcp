/**
 * Claimed-batch drain: the per-cycle processing pipeline (TASK-554 split out
 * of `worker.ts` `runOnce`).
 *
 * Phases, preserved exactly from the pre-split implementation:
 * - Phase 1 — parse payloads in memory (no DB reads). Unparseable jobs are
 *   completed as no-ops, matching the pre-batch behavior.
 * - Phase 2 — batch entity-existence check (OPT-PERF-03): one IN(...) read per
 *   entity kind for the whole claimed batch instead of one getById/getTaskById
 *   per job (~32 reads → ~3 reads). A job whose entity no longer exists is
 *   completed as a no-op exactly as before.
 * - Phase 3 — split the batch: only memory/standard/task jobs consume an ONNX
 *   embedding. codebase_symbol jobs are KG-only — writeVector is a deliberate
 *   NO-OP for them (TASK-293) and codebase_symbol_vectors is never populated,
 *   so batch-embedding them would burn 150-500ms of CPU per file for a vector
 *   that is immediately discarded (TASK-338 / code-review F1). Embed only the
 *   embed-needed subset and hand codebase jobs a placeholder vector that
 *   applyJob's writeVector branch never persists.
 *
 * Per-job BUSY discipline (TASK-457): each outbox write (no-op completes,
 * release, fail, success complete) is routed through {@link runOutboxWrite} so
 * a transient SQLITE_BUSY defers the write (lease-expiry self-heals) instead
 * of killing the cycle — and never counts as a job attempt or a `failed`
 * increment.
 *
 * Pure function over the worker's collaborators (outbox, store, vectors,
 * counters, latency series) — no worker instance state — so it can live in its
 * own sub-500-LOC module while `EmbeddingWorker` keeps lifecycle + scheduling.
