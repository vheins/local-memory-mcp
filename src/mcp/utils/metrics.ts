/**
 * In-process observability metrics registry (OPT-OBS-01).
 *
 * Records `performance.now()` deltas for the single tool-dispatch core
 * (tools/index.ts) and the embedding worker (embedding-queue/worker.ts), so
 * the OPT-PERF-01..11 optimizations become measurable and regression-testable.
 *
 * The registry is a module singleton that is **process-local by design**:
 * the MCP server and the dashboard run in separate processes, each feeding
 * its own instance. The dashboard `/api/system/metrics` endpoint reads the
 * dashboard process's instance (embed latency from its worker + any dispatch
 * that happens inside the dashboard process) and merges it with the worker's
 * own `getStats()`.
 *
 * Distribution tracking keeps a bounded sample reservoir per series so the
 * p50/p95 percentiles stay accurate without unbounded memory growth.
