/**
 * codebase_references — denormalized edge rows (Phase 1.1, migration v23).
 *
 * One row = one call / instantiation / import / heritage site emitted by a
 * language visitor during parsing. Two edge families share the table:
 *
 *   1. Call-site edges (v21): `symbol_name` is the referenced symbol (called
 *      identifier / constructed class / imported binding); the row lives in
 *      the CALLER's file (`caller_file`, `caller_line`, `caller_name`).
 *   2. Heritage edges (Wave 1, kinds 'extends' | 'implements'): `symbol_name`
 *      is the referenced base class / implemented interface; `caller_file`
 *      is the file declaring the derived type and `caller_line` the class
 *      declaration line.
 *
 * `target_file` / `target_symbol_id` (added v23) locate the referenced symbol
 * when resolvable at parse time (name-based resolution per ADR-002 — no LSP);
 * both are null for unresolved names. `kind` is the single enum-driven
 * taxonomy: 'call' | 'instantiation' | 'import' | 'extends' | 'implements' |
 * 'type'. The 'type' kind (added v26, issue #82) represents type-only
 * dependencies (parameter/return/property/alias/generic/union/intersection
 * usage) — distinguished further by an optional `role` column.
 *
 * Import metadata (added v27, issue #83): 'import' rows additionally carry
 * `local_name` / `imported_name` / `module_specifier` / `import_kind` so an
 * aliased import like `import { User as DomainUser } from '@/domain/user'`
 * records BOTH the local binding (DomainUser) and the canonical exported
 * name (User) with the raw module specifier — the info TRACE needs to expose
 * canonical targets for aliased imports.
