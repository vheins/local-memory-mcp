/**
 * Design system primitives.
 *
 * Every view composes from these. The rule is simple: if you are about to write
 * a page header, a card, a status pill, an empty state, a loading placeholder or
 * a filter row from scratch, you are about to create the twelfth variant of a
 * thing that already exists — import it from here instead.
 *
 * New primitives belong here only when a pattern appears in three or more
 * places. A one-off stays local to its view.
