	 * Memories — the workspace knowledge collection.
	 *
	 * Two structural fixes over the old inline block in App.svelte:
	 *
	 * 1. The page had no `<h1>`. Its title was a `.section-label` div — 11px,
	 *    uppercase, weight 800 — which announces as nothing to a screen reader
	 *    and reads as a chrome label rather than the name of the page.
	 * 2. "New Memory" was the sixth cell of the filter grid, weighted the same
	 *    as a page-size dropdown. The page's one primary action now lives in the
	 *    header, where the eye lands first and where every other page in the app
	 *    puts it.
