# Product Requirements Document (PRD) — Codebase Index

- **Feature:** Codebase Index
- **Project:** local-memory-mcp (`@vheins/local-memory-mcp`)
- **Status:** Draft
- **Date:** 2026-07-22

---

## Product Overview

Codebase Index is a first-class module of the local-memory-mcp MCP server that provides AI coding agents with instant structural awareness of a project's source code. It parses TypeScript and JavaScript files using tree-sitter WASM, extracts declarations (functions, classes, interfaces, types, enums, exports), and stores them in searchable SQLite tables within the existing `memory.db`.

**Problem:** AI agents exploring codebases currently burn 82K+ tokens per structural query through grep-and-read loops. They hallucinate function names (~30% error rate), miss cross-file dependencies, and re-discover codebase structure every session.

**Solution:** Agents query the code index via dedicated MCP tools — `search_symbols`, `get_file_symbols`, `trace_symbol`, `get_architecture` — getting accurate, structured results in <100ms at <1K tokens per query.

**Target release:** 0.5.0 (MVP), 0.6.0 (Phase 1.1), 0.7.0 (Phase 1.2)

## Target Personas

Reference: `target-users.md` for full persona definitions.

### Primary Persona: AI Coding Agent

The agent is the direct consumer of all Codebase Index MCP tools. It does not have a UI; it communicates exclusively via JSON-RPC.

**Needs:**

- Find function/class/type definitions by name in <100ms
- Understand all symbols exported from a file without reading the file body
- Trace call chains across files to assess change impact
- Get accurate parameter types and return types without guessing

### Persona: Senior Engineer (Indirect User)

Experienced developer working on monorepos who relies on AI agents for feature implementation.

**Needs:**

- AI agent correctly imports existing functions rather than reimplementing them
- AI-generated code compiles on first attempt (no hallucinated imports)
- Agent understands the existing architecture pattern before writing code

### Persona: Tech Lead (Indirect User)

Oversees 3-10 engineers, reviews PRs daily. Wants AI agents to respect architectural boundaries.

**Needs:**

- AI code adheres to existing module boundaries and dependency directions
- Review cycles shortened because AI avoids structural mistakes
- Architecture overview available for onboarding new team members

### Persona: OSS Maintainer (Indirect User)

Manages 1-3 open-source repos. Wants AI contributors to submit correct PRs without hand-holding.

**Needs:**

- AI contributor can understand codebase structure independently
- New contributors (human or AI) learn the codebase layout quickly
- Issues can be triaged with structural understanding

### Persona: Indie Developer (Indirect User)

Solo full-stack developer switching between projects frequently.

**Needs:**

- Fast context rehydration when returning to a project after weeks away
- AI doesn't need to re-discover codebase shape every session
- Single tool covers memory + tasks + code indexing
