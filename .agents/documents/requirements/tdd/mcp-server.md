# Technical Design Document (TDD)

> **VERIFIED vs IMPLEMENTATION (2026-08-08):** core components (SQLite WAL + better-sqlite3, Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 384-dim ONNX, compromise NLP, proper-lockfile write locking, stdio JSON-RPC 2.0, Zod v4, tsup/Vite) all verified. Corrections: (1) `_schema_version` is **v23**, not v2; (2) collision threshold `0.55` → shipped **0.85** (`MEMORY_CONFLICT_THRESHOLD`); (3) hybrid search keyword leg is FTS5-based (v04/v10/v18) + ONNX vectors via `scoreHybrid` 40/30/15/15 — "TF-IDF Cosine Similarity" is legacy wording; (4) "31 markdown files" prompts → **32**; (5) tool names `memory-store`/`memory-search` below are legacy (`memory-write`/`memory-read`); `memory-summarize` → `repo-summarize`; `memory-synthesize` → `synthesize`; (6) bulk chunk 500 (`BULK_UPDATE_CHUNK_SIZE`) verified; (7) soul-maintenance config (7 days / 0.5 / min 1 / immunized tags / <24h startup sweep) verified; (8) NLP Archivist runs via embedding outbox worker (TASK-013), not inline on every write.

## Architecture Overview

The system implements a local-first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed for semantic memory management, task lifecycle tracking, coding standards, knowledge graphs, and multi-agent coordination.

## Core Components

- **Persistence Engine**: SQLite (via `better-sqlite3`) with WAL mode for concurrent reads.
- **Embedding Engine**: Local ONNX execution via `@xenova/transformers`. Uses `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dim vectors).
- **NLP Engine**: `compromise` + `compromise-dates` for entity extraction and temporal query parsing.
- **State Management**: ACID-compliant transactions with `proper-lockfile` cross-process write locking.
- **Communication Layer**: MCP Standard (STDIO/JSON-RPC 2.0).
- **Schema Validation**: Zod v4 for all tool input validation.
- **Build**: tsup for TypeScript bundling, Vite for dashboard frontend.

## Search Algorithms

### Memory Search (Hybrid)

- **TF-IDF Cosine Similarity**: Client-side computation from token frequency vectors.
- **Neural Vector Similarity**: ONNX embeddings compared via cosine similarity.
- **Combined Score**: Weighted average of both scores for final ranking.
- **Ranking Bias**: Repo affinity boost + importance tiebreaker.

### Standard Search

- Same hybrid approach as memory search, scoped to coding standards.

## Key Implementation Details

### Collision Detection

- `memory-store` performs semantic conflict checking (threshold 0.55) on new entries.

### Task Lifecycle Enforcement

- Transition validation: `backlog`/`pending`/`blocked` → `in_progress` → `completed`.
- Token requirement: `est_tokens` mandatory on completion.
- Auto-archiving: Completion triggers `archiveTaskToMemory()`.

### Soul Maintenance (Memory Decay)

- **Default Configuration**: 7 days inactivity, decay rate 0.5, min importance 1.
- **Immunization**: Tags can exclude memories from decay.
- **Schedule**: Runs at startup (checks if <24h since last run).

### NLP Archivist

- **Library**: `compromise` for entity extraction.
- **Trigger**: Runs on every `memory-store` via `kg-archivist.ts`.
- **Output**: Entities stored in `entities` table, relations inferred from co-occurrence.

### Exploration Observations

Use `observation-write` for evidence-backed facts discovered while inspecting a repository, such as a symbol contract, dependency edge, implementation constraint, or verified defect. Every observation belongs to an `owner`/`repo` scope and must include at least one file pointer; symbol and line coordinates are optional. Bulk writes are committed in one transaction and normalized subject/fact/evidence identity makes retries idempotent.

Use `observation-read` to retrieve those findings by id, subject, task, file, symbol, or confidence. Compact reads return evidence counts only; set `hydrate_evidence: true` when exact pointers are needed. Stale, superseded, and unverifiable observations are excluded from list/context reads unless `include_stale: true`.

Freshness is fingerprint-driven and never invokes an LLM. Each evidence pointer stores the source file checksum plus a structural symbol fingerprint (name, kind, export flags, signature, doc comment, semantic signature). Incremental indexing revalidates only the observations attached to changed files: an unchanged symbol stays `valid` even when its file changed, a changed or deleted symbol becomes `stale`, a missing index makes the observation `unverifiable` rather than silently valid, renames carry evidence pointers to the new path, and deletions mark the row stale with a reason. `observation-write.refresh_ids` is the bounded, owner/repo-scoped lazy revalidation path; a new observation may supersede an old one via `supersedes_id`. Raw source text is deliberately excluded from this domain.

Use `memory-write` instead for durable conclusions that should survive beyond a particular exploration run: architectural decisions, reusable patterns, mistakes, code facts worth recalling semantically, and completed-task archives. An observation is source-grounded evidence; a memory is curated long-term knowledge. Promote a validated observation into memory rather than treating both stores as interchangeable.

### Write Locking

- All mutation tools use `WriteLock.withLock()` via `proper-lockfile`.
- File-based, cross-process locking for multi-process safety.

### Bulk Operations

- All bulk operations use transaction chunk size of 500 records.

### Upstream Compatibility

> **LEGACY DESIGN INTENT — NOT IMPLEMENTED (verified 2026-08-08):** the alias tools below were never shipped; no `remember_fact` / `remember_facts` / `recall` / `forget` tools or aliases exist in `src/mcp`. Canonical tools are `memory-store`, `memory-search`, `memory-delete`, etc. Retained for historical record only.

- Alias tools registered via SDK `registerTool()`:
  - `remember_fact` → `memory-store`
  - `remember_facts` → `memory-store` (bulk)
  - `recall` → `memory-search`
  - `forget` → `memory-delete`

### Reference Catalog

- **Prompts**: 31 markdown files in `src/mcp/prompts/definitions/` loaded via `loader.ts`.
- **Resources**: All exposed via standard MCP resource URIs.
- **Auto-Injection**: `{{current_repo}}` replaced with active repo in prompt templates.
